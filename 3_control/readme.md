# **Learn Robotics - Control**
This repository contains notes and examples of control strategies of robots.

## **Content**
### 1- Introduction to joint control: 
- transfer function of a motor and simple control
- Simulink simulation
### 2- Joint control
- Ideal vs realistic simulations on Two-link planar (RR)
- Examples of different controllers:
    - PD control
    - PID control
    - Full state feedback control (Pole Placement and LQR)
    - Gravity compensated control
    - Inverse Dynamics control
    - Robust control
### 3- Task control
- Ideal simulations on Two-link planar (RR)
- Examples of different controllers:
    - PID control
    - Gravity compensated PD control
    - Full state feedback control (Pole Placement and LQR)
    - Inverse Dynamics control
    - Robust control (Sliding mode control)


## **Notes**
- Don't forget to  add the contents of `library` folder to MATLAB path. 

## TODO
- Simulation example of robot control in ROS.
- Add control simulation of mobile robots
- Add control simulation of drones.
