# **Learn Robotics - Kinematics**
This repository contains notes and examples of driving and using kinematics. This also extends to differential kinematics and concepts like singularity and velocity ellipsoids.

## **Content**
###  1. Planar Manipulators (MATLAB live script)
###  2. Forward and inverse kinematics of three-link planar (MATLAB live script)
###  3. Three-link planar from URDF and waypoint tracking (MATLAB live script)

### TODO
- Kinematics example using ROS
- Mobile robots kinematics!
