- Conversion between states in body-fixed frame and inertial frame
### 2 Drone (Quadcopter) modeling
- Developing the equations of motions of a quadcopter
- Simulation of the model in Matlab and Simulink
### 3- Attitude control
- Control allocation and motor control
- Body rates control
- Euler angles based attitude control
- Rotation matrix based attitude control
- Quaternion based attitude control

### 4- Position control
- Position and velocity controller 
- Thrust to attitude conversion

### 5- State estimation
- Simulation of IMU sensor
- Attitude state estimation using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)


## **Notes**
- Run the live script before running the simulation to set necessary parameters
