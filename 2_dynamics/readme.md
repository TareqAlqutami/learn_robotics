# **Learn Robotics - Dynamics**
This repository contains notes and examples of driving and using robot dynamics.This involves rigid bodies and equation of motions.

## **Content**
### 1. Rigid body dynamics
- Intro rigid body dynamics and equation of motions
- Simulate dynamics of a two-link planar arm using Robotics Toolbox
### 2. Two-link Planar dynamics
- Formulate the dynamics using Lagrange formulation
- Simulate the dynamics in Simulink
- Compare derived dynamics to SimScape multibody model

## **Notes**
- Don't forget to ensure adding the contents of `library` folder to MATLAB path. 

## TODO
- Simulation example of robot manipulator dynamics in Gazebo+ROS.
- Add dynamics and simulation of mobile robots
- Add dynamics formulation and simulation of drone
